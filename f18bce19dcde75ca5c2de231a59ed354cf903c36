      "message": "I guess the benefit of this commit is to have multiple configurations easily switchable (like in Kalamar), but the drawback is the need to remember which one to choose for deployment. I think, that\u0027s why Kustvakt doesn\u0027t support it. I have no general objections, but it means the currently deployed version needs to be deployed differently and this has to be recognized in the systemd.",
